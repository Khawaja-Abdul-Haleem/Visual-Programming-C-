Define a class in C# with following description:
flightNo, destination, distance and fuel (must be private variables). A member function "CALFUEL( )"
to calculate the value of Fuel as per the following criteria

 Distance                    Fuel
<=800                        500
> 800 and <=1800             1500
> 1800                       3000 

A function “SETDATA( )” allows user to enter values for flight number, destination, distance & call
function CALFUEL( ) to calculate the quantity of fuel. A function “SHOWDATA( )” allows user to view
the content of all the data members. Write a main function to demonstrate above class functionalities.
